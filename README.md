You need a Gmail account that is not set up for OAUTH, it will require some security settings turned off to just allow username/password access

System labels (e.g ^i) can be used too labels are here - > https://developers.google.com/gmail/android/com/google/android/gm/contentprovider/GmailContract.Labels.LabelCanonicalNames

** Don't use this for any sensitive information, i am just using it for generic alert messages, and the account name has no personally identifiable information

# Imstallation / Usage

This installation assumes you are running the latest version of Vera software.

1. Upload the icon mail.png file to the appropriate storage location on your controller. For Vera that's `/www/cmh/skins/default/icons`
3. Upload the .xml and .json file in the repository to the appropriate storage location on your controller. For Vera that's via Apps/Develop Apps/Luup files/
4. Create the decice instance via the appropriate route. For Vera that's Apps/Develop Apps/Create Device/ and putting "D_GMailAtom1.xml" into the Upnp Device Filename box. 
5. Reload luup to establish the device and then reload luup again (just to be sure) and you should be good to go.

# Quick Configuration script

After you have added the files and created the device, the following is a quick way to configure the device, simply update the following and run it via Apps/Develop Apps/Test Code 

````
local DEVICE = 1194  -- Device ID assigned on Vera
local ATOM_SERV = "urn:nodecentral-net:serviceId:GMailAtom1"

local PASSWORD = "your_password"
local CUSTOM_LABELS = "Vera, ^all, "  -- Label(s) to be checked
local DISPLAY_LABEL = "Vera"  -- Label of count you want to appear on the UI
luup.variable_set(ATOM_SERV, "USERNAME", USERNAME, DEVICE)
luup.variable_set(ATOM_SERV, "PASSWORD", PASSWORD, DEVICE)
luup.variable_set(ATOM_SERV, "CUSTOM_LABELS", CUSTOM_LABELS, DEVICE)
luup.variable_set(ATOM_SERV, "DISPLAY_LABEL", DISPLAY_LABEL, DEVICE)
